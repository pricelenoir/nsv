<pre>
- x.jgr - newgraph and newcurve pts.  Show how to create ps, pdf, jpg.
  Talk about eps.

- Now, do three lines:
    just pts
    marktype triangle linetype solid
    marktype none linetype dashed color 1 0 0  - have points include 0,0 so axis looks good.


- Esoterica:
     comments
     newline instead of newcurve marktype none linetype solid
     word based -- six constructs:
       - pages
       - graphs
       - axes
       - curves
       - strings
       - legends
     can include filename

Axes -- show axis.jgr and its results.
        Go over shash.

Curves -- Edit simp2.jgr to set the mark sizes differently and use fill / cfill.

Strings -- Just talk about things you can do.  justification; rotation.
           Maybe add a string or two to simp2.jgr.

Legend -- Again, mess with simp2.jgr and add a legend.  
          Then move it.
          Then rotate it and set its fonts.

Hash_labels -- go over hlabels.jgr

Bar graphs -- just say what xbar and ybar are and move on.

Polygons -- again, just talk about it -- show poly.jpg.

Bezier curve.  Say what they are, and then show football_cp.jgr

The shell:

    1. show jgraph of an awk script that graphs i*i from 0 < i < 3.
    2: Talk about grep and awk.
       Show ap-timings.txt, and floyd.jgr

Postscript marks -- just show the results of fbf.jgr -- don't worry about the source.
       Or if you want, go through the source.

"Small Multiples" -- x_translate y_translate. copygraph.  Show copygraph.jgr.

Finally -- fun uses of jgraph -- 
       2019-IJCNN.jpg
       heatmap.jpg
       convolution.jpg and conv_2.jpg
       PCB.jpg
   
       And show the examples from the jgraph lab.
