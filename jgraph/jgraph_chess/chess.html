<i>Note from Dr. P -- if you're on a Mac, this code will have issues, because Mac's
ignore case with filenames.  So "p.jpg" and "P.jpg" are identical.  I've fixed the
pictures for this web page, but if you're using the code, keep it in mind.</i>

While taking Dr. Plank's Advanced Programming and Algorithms course in
the Fall of 2019 I became fascinated with <b>jgraph</b>. The main reason I
was fascinated with <b>jgraph</b> had to do with my love for Latex. Since
<b>jgraph</b> can be converted to postscript, and postscript can be
embedded in Latex, it is easy to create great graphics for research papers
- and presentations with the Latex document class beamer. Because postscript
uses vector graphics, you get no loss in quality which typically happens
when trying to cram some jpeg in a paper column or presentation slide.
<br/>
<br/>
Following the semester, I decided to create <b>jgraph</b> chess graphics
and an accompanying program to setup chess positions. First of all, the reasoning
for doing this is my love for chess. Secondly, creating good chess graphics
is important if I ever decide to create a chess writeup or presentation. The
number of bad chess graphics that publishers still produce is astonishing to me. There are often negative reviews on a chess book just because of its poor quality in chessboard graphics. 
<br/>
<br/>
It should be noted that there is a chessboard Latex package developed by Ulrike Fischer that is much more complete. The link to that package is <a href=https://ctan.org/pkg/chessboard>https://ctan.org/pkg/chessboard</a>. I developed the <b>jgraph</b> chess example as a use case to show the effectiveness of <b>jgraph</b>, not to compete with Fischer's package.
<hr>

<h2>Creating the Chessboard</h2>
First, let's walk through creating a chessboard in <b>jgraph</b>. A standard chessboard has 64 squares - 8 rows known as ranks and 8 columns known as files. Ranks are numbered 1 through 8. Files are lettered A through H. The board is essentially a grid. Each square is uniquely specified by its file and rank, respectively.

    for (rank = 1; rank <= 8; rank++) { \
        if (rank % 2 == 0) file = 2; \
        else file = 1; \
        for (; file <= 8; file += 2) { \
            printf("newline poly gray 1 ppattern estripe 45 pfill .7 pts "); \
            printf("%f %f %f %f %f %f %f %f\n", \
                file - .5, rank - .5, \
                file + .5, rank - .5, \
                file + .5, rank + .5, \
                file - .5, rank + .5); \
        } \
    } \
}'

Notice how I automatically generated the dark squares instead of laboriously brute forcing each square. Because <b>jgraph</b> allows you to execute a sh command using the ``shell'' keyword, we can create all of our squares via another language and embed this in our <b>jgraph</b> code for readability. I chose to create the dark squares using <b>awk</b> (see <a href=http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs494/494/notes/Awk/lecture.html>Dr. Plank's Awk Lecture</a>). I like <b>awk</b> because it reads like <b>C</b>, but you can use whatever language you want to get the job done. I use this same technique to generate chess pieces (see section <b>Creating Chess Pieces</b>).
<br/>
<br/>
Also, to make things simpler, I chose to have each square be a 1 x 1 square with the xaxis and yaxis going from 0.5 to 8.5. This will allow us later to specify piece placement by putting them on their exact row and column. This makes writing a program to generate piece locations easier.

<h2>Creating Chess Pieces</h2>

Similar to the football (<a href=http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs494/494/notes/Jgraph/fbf.jgr>fbf.jgr</a>) example from Dr. Plank's notes, we want to create encapsulated postscript (<b>eps</b>) marks to be used with our chessboard. First, I created all of the chesspieces in <b>jgraph</b>. Let's go through a few examples:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td valign=top><pre>
(* white chess pawn *)
newgraph
xaxis min 0 max 10 nodraw

    2 2 0 2 0 0

(* pawn center circle *)
newline poly pfill 1 linethickness 10 pts
    shell : echo "" | awk '{ \
        pi = atan2(0, -1); \
        for (i = 0; i <= 360; i += 1) { \
            printf(" %f %f",2*sin(i*pi/180)+5,2*cos(i*pi/180)+6); \
        } printf("\n") }'

(* pawn top circle *)
newline poly pfill 1 linethickness 10 pts
    shell : echo "" | awk '{ \
        pi = atan2(0, -1); \
        for (i = 0; i <= 360; i += 1) { \
            printf(" %f %f",1*sin(i*pi/180)+5,1*cos(i*pi/180)+9); \
        } printf("\n") }'
</pre></td>
<td><img src=images/P-W.jpg width=300></td>
</table></center><p>

Above is a white chess pawn. This white pawn is made up of three simple elements: the base, the center circle, the top circle. The base can be described as a <b>jgraph</b> bezier polygon. You will notice there are straight lines in this polygon. I just specify a straight line by putting the two bezier control points collinearly between the endpoints. I fill the polygon with white (pfill 1) so that when the piece is on a dark square we do not see the square background in the middle of the piece. After we have the base, the head of the pawn is two circles. While I could have worked out each individual point along the circles, it is much easier to let <b>awk</b> do the work for us.
<br/>
<br/>
We can easily alter the white pawn to be a black pawn by changing the pfill to 0 of each of the three polygons. The black pawn looks as follows:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td valign=top><pre>

    shell : echo "" | awk '{ \
        pi = atan2(0, -1); \
        for (i = 0; i <= 360; i += 1) { \
            printf(" %f %f",2*sin(i*pi/180)+5,2*cos(i*pi/180)+6); \
        } printf("\n") }'

(* pawn top circle *)

    shell : echo "" | awk '{ \
        pi = atan2(0, -1); \
        for (i = 0; i <= 360; i += 1) { \
            printf(" %f %f",1*sin(i*pi/180)+5,1*cos(i*pi/180)+9); \
        } printf("\n") }'
</pre></td>

All of the other chess pieces were generated in a similar manner. The images of the resulting pieces are below.

<h2>Putting it all together</h2>

Now that we have postscript pieces. We can embed them as marks,
placing them on the chessboard. For example, if we want to create
the inititial chess position seen at the beginning of a match, we
might do the following.

Here is the jgraph code and resulting image:

The jgraph board code is exactly the same as the empty board shown previously; we just have to specify where we would like to place the pieces. For example, the white king is specified by the following code:

<p>
<font color="darkred"><b>newcurve eps ps_pieces/K.ps marksize 8 8 pts 45 5</b></font>
</p>

While typing this everytime works, it can be quite tedious to try and calculate the location of where you want to place each piece, especially when most all the pieces are left on the board. We probably want a more intuitive way to specify piece locations.

<hr>
<h2>Generating a specific board in a more intuitive way</h2>

<p>In chess there are several different formats one can use to specify a particular board and/or the current state of the game. The International Chess Federation (FIDE) requires players to write down their moves using standard algebraic notation. Another common notation is the Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN), which describes the current state of a game. As an example here, we will use a format similar to the GNU Chess (<a href=https://www.gnu.org/software/chess/>https://www.gnu.org/software/chess/</a>) board output in terminal mode.</p>

<p>The format goes like this. Each square's state is specified by a character. Below is a chart of all the possible square states and their corresponding character representation.</p>
<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3>
    <tr>
        <th>Character</th>
        <th>Square State</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>.</td>
        <td>empty square</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>P</td>
        <td>white pawn on square</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>B</td>
        <td>white bishop on square</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>N</td>
        <td>white knight on square</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>R</td>
        <td>white rook on square</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>K</td>
        <td>white king on square</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Q</td>
        <td>white queen on square</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>p</td>
        <td>black pawn on square</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>b</td>
        <td>black bishop on square</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>n</td>
        <td>black knight on square</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>r</td>
        <td>black rook on square</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>k</td>
        <td>black king on square</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>q</td>
        <td>black queen on square</td>
    </tr>
</pre></td>
</table></center><p>

<p>Each row of the board is specified by eight of the above characters and is terminated by a newline. The board is specified from the white player's perspective. For example, the initial board would be specified by the following:</p>

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td valign=top><pre>
rnbqkbnr
pppppppp
........
........
........
........
PPPPPPPP
RNBQKBNR
</pre></td>
</table></center><p>

This representation will make it much easier to specify a particular board. We now need a way of converting this representation to a jgraph chess board with the pieces located in their corresponding positions. I have written a C program (<a href=gen_chessboard.c>gen_chessboard.c</a>), which will translate the board for us.

<hr>
<h2>Final Example</h2>

<p>
Let's say we want to specify Fischer versus Spassky, Game 6 of the 1972 World Chess Championship, widely known as the Match of the Century, taking place during the Cold War. The final board of the game is in the file <a href=example_boards/fischer_spassky_game6_1972.txt>example_boards/fischer_spassky_game6_1972.txt</a> and shown below:
<p>

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td valign=top><pre>
....q..k
..r.r...
....PR.p
p.p.....
P.Bp...P
.P......
......P.
......K.
</pre></td>
</table></center><p>

We want to convert this to a jgraph board. We can use our C program <b>gen_chessboard</b>. It can read the board directly off of stdin. In order to generate the board, we could run the following:

<pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>cat example_boards/fischer_spassky_game6_1972.txt | ./gen_chessboard >fischer_spassky_game6_1972.jgr</b></font>
